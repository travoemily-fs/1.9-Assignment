This week we focused on building our own API to pull information from, the goal being
a fully functional application that can add, delete, and update data. I went into
this week with a solid foundation of background knowledge in API building, particularly
using MongoDB, Mongoose, and Postman to build up my endpoints. I really enjoy the
process of building a database - maybe that's because I get to control what type
of data I'm collecting because I don't know if I would have the same sentiments if
I was working with something that wasn't appealing to me.{" "}

The last API I built was a Harry Potter based application, using two different models: one for the characters, the other for sorting into the four Hogwarts houses. It was a bit more complex than this API so I was pretty confident building up something that is based off a single model without relational data. I decided to use one of my favorite shows, 'The Boys' as my model. I created a very rough in-character database where users could engage in the creation, deletion, and updating of pre-existing character profiles. I'm not 100% comfortable in building the scaffolding up for these fullstack apps, so going along with the tutorial videos provided was helpful and I was able to build my API alongside these lectures without encountering too many errors or issues along the way. I was proud of myself for catching and fixing errors in the structure before the teacher spotted the issues himself.

Something that I realized is super important for me when I'm building up these complex front and backend applications is outlining my work. That is, taking the time before I start coding to construct a 'to-do' list that includes any logic that I'll need to sort out. I've had a lot of trouble in the past with getting React to work with dependencies that are outdated in the past, so I went into the creation of this application aware and mindful of what design framework I select to build the UI portion of my project. The separation of package.json files between frontend and backend as well as universal dependencies was helpful and reduced a lot of stress I typically have when I'm trying to install dependencies into a project.

Overall, I'm getting more comfortable with working with data of all types. This is a huge milestone for me as I've always been someone intimidated by numbers and complex logic problems. Taking everything one step at a time and covering all my bases is a skill I'm continuing to nurse. Practice makes perfect after all!
