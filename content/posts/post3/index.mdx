I often find myself thinking (usually when I'm borderline delirious after a day of coding), how did the developers before me accomplish what they did without outside guidance? In this modern day and age, we've got Google, Reddit, Stack Overflow, all of our text books digitalized, and... robots? Yes. Robots. And these robots have everyone acting crazy.

Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is our version of the moon race. Every country is stumbling over themselves to find a way to 'perfect' AI first because we all know the moment that we do, life as we know it will never be the same. It sounds scary; remember that one movie with Will Smith? IRobot? It feels a lot like that and we're one wrong away from our toasters becoming the Terminator. Now it's not all bad. AI in the medical field is actively saving lives. Surgeons have been using robots in lieu of invasive procedures for years now and that tech is only getting better and smarter the more we develop it. AI's that are being built to scan mammograms to detect breast cancer are better at it than most seasoned radiographers.

There are just some things that AI will always be more skilled at than humans. Humans are, after all, not immune to error. Then again, AI is a human innovation, ripe with flaws that aren't all known or understood despite our continued attempts to harness and weaponize it. The way the media presents it is relatively tame, but it's obvious that none of us know what we're doing and the potential chaos that could ensue. AI is kind of like Pandora's Box... once we open it up, we'll never be able to close it again and the consequences will be our's to face. Whatever they are.

Am I the only one reminded of J. Robert Oppenheimer here? What was it that he said after he helped develop the first nuclear weapon of mass destruction? Oh yeah, I remember:

"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

Just food for thought!
