This week we dove into uncharted territory for me: mobile application development. I don’t know why the subject was so daunting to me at first; I’m no expert in React but it’s a framework that I am familiar with and can understand the basics of. I approached this new material cautiously optimistic and to my delight, the process of installing xcode and the IOS framework onto my Mac was the most difficult part. I was amazed at how xcode is able to simulate an Iphone’s interface with such attention to detail. The mockup is fully functional; it’s just like having a phone running on your desktop. It’s pretty neat. On Visual Studio code, my worries were further elevated by the familiarity of the project set up. Seeing the usual suspects like ‘package.json’, separate folders for components and assets, and a centralized ‘app.js’ file helped boost my confidence. I could do this . It’s not nearly as intimidating as I have let myself believe.

I also wanted to touch on how cool it is that Expo helps make converting our applications to different operating systems so simple. We can go from IOS to Android to the web and there and back again with very little effort on our parts. I think it’s important to be able to develop for multiple different software types even if one is more popular than the other. It’s interesting how in America we prioritize IOS because I have a friend studying computer engineering in Spain and they are primarily taught with Microsoft and Android being the focus, so cross compatibility is something that I know will give me a boost professionally.

My biggest takeaway from React Native? Having a firm understanding of basic React functionality and syntax is essential. Think of application building a lot like constructing an actual building, React is like the cement foundation that holds everything together. Without it, the structure has no support. It might not be the first thing we see when looking at a building, but without it, we have nothing. If anything, I’m more inspired now than I ever have been to practice my React skills. I want to think of something small-scale I can develop on my own just to keep myself on my toes and challenge myself. The more comfortable I get with React, the easier everything else will be.
