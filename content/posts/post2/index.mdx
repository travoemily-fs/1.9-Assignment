My first love in the realm of coding and app development came from my appreciation for visual design and aesthetics. The first time I opened up Adobe Photoshop, I was thirteen years old and now seventeen years later, visual design still holds a prominent place in my heart. Designing the ideal visual experience for users is just as crucial (if not more crucial) as the backend functionality of the app is. What good is an adeptly coded webpage if it's impossible to use and navigate, if the color scheme is too harsh and the words are illegible, or if the links aren't clickable because the cursor is too small?

Companies, especially, rely on the usability of their platform to bring in and keep existing customers. A poorly designed website is going hinder the company's reputation and ultimately cost money - which is the last thing any developer wants! A seasoned UI/UX developer not only thinks like a coder, they put themselves into the user's shoes. There is an art to it beyond font pairings and color contrasts. Psychology plays a part in it too, identifying common human 'quirks' and covering all of the bases. Beyond designing, accessibility always has to be a top priority for frontend developing. Users who are hard of hearing, have visual impairments, or other specialized needs have every right to enjoy the web the same way as everyone else does. You have to care about other humans and think beyond ourselves to put what's best for others first. An accessible site isn't an ugly site. You can still create stunning user interfaces. There should never be a compromise between the two. Like I said before, there is more to the frontend developing experience than meets the eye.

I intend on pursuing a career in frontend development, so I'm probably biased in my adoration and praise for UI/UX design. I just think it's neat.
