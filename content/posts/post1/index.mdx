I've learned so many amazing things thus far into my web engineering program; far too many tips and tricks to list in one sitting. But if I had to select one thing in particular that has completely changed the game for me, it would have to be CSS-in-JS. As coders, solving problems is the name of the game. CSS-in-JS represents a collection of solutions that directly address some of the more commonly encountered issues that arise during the development stages of application design and deployment. The needs of web-based users have expanded and become increasingly more complex, and as a result the way we code web applications need to be able to keep up with demand. Typically in the past we've seen CSS and JS separated, housed in separate files which is fine in theory until we start building massive applications and we're drowning in a sea of files and folders that are increasing the size of our app and slowing everything else down as a result.

Say we have a sidebar component... before CSS-in-JS, there were two separate files to make up this one component; it's Javascript functionality, and the styling of it's parts. Again, seems like an okay concept until there are hundreds, if not thousands of components making up our application. This is where CSS-in-JS comes in and why I'm absolutely obsessed with it. Why separate the styling and the functionality of our components when they can co-exist in the same file? Not only is the process easy to learn (you just need basic CSS and Javascript knowledge to make the conversion), it helps streamline efficacy in dev teams and improves the overall code integrity, making a better and more reliable application. Anything that makes the jobs of developers easier without hindering the user experience is a huge deal in the creation of web and cloud based applications. With CSS-in-JS, everyone is happy and teams are more productive. What more could you want?
